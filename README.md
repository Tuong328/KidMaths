Need to study for a math test or create a countless number of questions with variations of the same topics?
If so, KidMaths is for you! 
Input your questions with number ranges and get random questions containing those numbers.
Whenever you want to create a range simply name the variable and add a colon, (i.e. x:), assign a range of numbers (lowest to highest) to that variable with a comma in between (i.e. 3,5), and contain that range within 4 Percent (%) signs.
Example: %%x: 3, 5"

Pros:
Kids can't cheat off of each other if they don't have the same questions.
Teachers can easily create questions and solutions in a timely manner.
Limitless potential to practice with an unlimited number of different math problems.

Cons:
People who hate math will not like this application of our programming skills :(
